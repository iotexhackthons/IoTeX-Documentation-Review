# Basic Concepts

I really like the inclusion of this section. But I definitely think this area of the documentation should be highlighted a lot more from the start. Under ***Software Tools -> Get Started***, I think there should be some type of reference/links to the ***Basic Concepts***. Nice graphics too, I like the one on the ***Blockchain Nodes*** section. I think fleshing out the ***Basic Concepts*** section as a whole would be valuable for people just getting started.
